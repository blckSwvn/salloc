# salloc — simple allocator in C

`salloc` is a **custom memory allocator** I built from scratch in C.  
It’s not a drop-in replacement for `malloc`/`free`, but a simplified more hands on allocator that manages a fixed memory arenas with its own metadata and free list.

and still not finished.

salloc is specfically made for another project im working on
